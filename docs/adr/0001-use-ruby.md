# 1. Use Ruby

## Status

✅ Accepted

## Context

A language for the project needs to be chosen.

- This is a solo hobby project (for now)
- I am the main target user
- Ruby is my favorite language
- Most of the MCP ecosystem is written in Python or TypeScript

## Decision

I will use **Ruby**.

## Consequences

- 👍 Development will be more fun for me.
- 👎🏻 Tooling and libraries are not as mature as for Python or TypeScript.
- 👎🏻 Common best practices or patterns for MCP Server development in Ruby are
  not yet established. So I will have to come up with my own.
  - But this is also a fun opportunity to come up with some.
