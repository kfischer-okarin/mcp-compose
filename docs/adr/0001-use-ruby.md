# 1. Use Ruby

## Status

✅ Accepted

## Context

Obviously a programming language must be chosen before starting to make the
tool. Most of the popular MCP libraries or servers seem to be written in Python
or TypeScript. But this is a personal side project and Ruby is my favorite
language.

## Decision

I will use Ruby.

## Consequences

- 👍 Development will be more fun for me.
- 👎🏻 Tooling and libraries are not as mature as for Python or TypeScript.
- 👎🏻 Common best practices or patterns for MCP Server development in Ruby are
  not yet established. So I will have to come up with my own.
